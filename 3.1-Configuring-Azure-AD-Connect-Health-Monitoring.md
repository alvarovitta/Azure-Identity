# Configuring Azure AD Connect Health Monitoring
Use the procedure described in this section to configure Azure AD Connect health monitoring. Use Azure AD Connect Health to monitor and gain insights into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. 
<br />
<br />

Azure AD Connect Health provides monitoring capabilities for:
- [AD FS Servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect-health/active-directory-aadconnect-health#azure-ad-connect-health-for-ad-fsactive-directory-aadconnect-health-adfsmd) 

- [Azure AD Connect servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect-health/active-directory-aadconnect-health#azure-ad-connect-health-for-syncactive-directory-aadconnect-health-syncmd)
- [Active Directory domain controllers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect-health/active-directory-aadconnect-health#azure-ad-connect-health-for-ad-dsactive-directory-aadconnect-health-addsmd). 

The data provided by this monitoring capability provides key usage data to help make informed decisions about the identity infrastructure.
