# Adding a Custom Domain Name to Azure AD

Use the procedure described in this section to add a custom domain name to Azure AD.

Every Azure AD directory comes with an initial domain name in the form of: domainname.onmicrosoft.com. The initial domain name cannot be changed or deleted. You can however, add your corporate domain name to Azure AD. 

Adding custom domain names to Azure AD gives you the ability to assign user names in the directory which will be familiar to your users.
**Example:  alice@yourdomainname.com**  instead of:  **alice@yourdomainname.onmicrosoft.com**. 



## Guidance

  - If you plan to federate your on-premises Windows Server AD with Azure AD, select the "I plan to configure this domain for single sign-on with my local Active Directory" checkbox when you run the Azure AD Connect tool to synchronize your directories. Register the same domain name you selected for federating with your on-premises directory in the Azure AD Domain step in the wizard. 

  - You can add a maximum of 900 managed domain names. If you are configuring all of your domains for federation on-premises with Active Directory, you can add up to a maximum of 450 domain names in each directory.
