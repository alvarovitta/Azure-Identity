# Using the Sync + ADFS Hybrid Identity Pattern

Use the Sync + ADFS Hybrid Identity Pattern for organizations with security and compliance policy restrictions. 

Some security policies may prevent user passwords, even in a hashed form, from being sent to external  destinations. Alternatively, some policies may require validation of user credentials through an on-premise active  directory. 

The figure below illustrates the Sync + ADFS Identity Pattern: 

	• The pattern retains all authentication on-premises
	
	• All passwords are stored on-premises only
	
	• All authentication traffic is redirected from the Azure AD to the on-premises Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS). The ADFS authenticates the user against a trusted Active Directory domain.

Advantages	Disadvantages
Depending on the resource is being accessed, you can use the same password to authenticate the user either in the cloud or on-premises.	Requires use of a federation service provider such as Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) in addition to AAD Sync.
Improved user experience. 	
Reduced password-related help-desk support effort and cost
