# Governing Azure AD Global Administrator Roles
Use the guidance provided in this section when considering how to configure the Global Administrator Role and to protect privileged accounts. 
<br />
<br />

## Guidance 
When determining how to configure the Global Administrator Role, consider the following proven practices to protect privileged accounts:

- Elevating any users/custom administrators to Global Administrator status grants access to all administrative features in Azure AD and Office 365. These users will have the ability to assign Administrator roles to other users. 

- Leverage non-Global Administrator roles to perform required administrative work with the least privileges necessary to complete the task. 
- Using roles such as: Password Administrator or Exchange Online Administrator reduce the number of high-value, high-impact Global Administrator role holders. A reduced number of Global Administrator roles reduces the possibility of a breach of an account having Global Administrator privileges. 
- Designate less than five Administrators (but more than two) global tenant administrators. The more Global Administrators you have, the more likely it is that one of those accounts will be successfully breached by an external attacker.
- Designate alternate roles for Global Administrators so they can complete required tasks using the least privileged access permissions. 
- Apply the “least privilege” approache to your administrative model, including:
  - Limit the number of Administrators or members of privileged groups
  - Delegate less privileges to accounts (just enough administration)
  - Provide privileges on demand (just in time) 	
  - Have existing Administrators perform tasks instead of adding additional Administrators
  - Provide processes for emergency access and rare use scenarios
- Designate at least two Global Administrators to ensure that you can protect against a rogue insider and to ensure a breach of one of those accounts can be recovered.
- Don’t use generic accounts for Global Administrators. There is no accountability or traceability to an individual and it can be shared.
- Create separate accounts for Global Administrator privileged role members and name them accordingly (e.g. GA-Admin-JSmith for Global Administrators).
- Ensure the Global Administrator accounts you select are managed accounts. i.e. Corporate accounts that are within your Azure AD Tenant or Synced from on-premises AD.
- Create a break glass account (ensure credentials are vaulted) that can be used in case of emergencies should something occur to Global Administrator accounts.
