# Governing Azure AD Global Administrator Roles
Use the guidance provided in this section when considering how to configure the Global Administrator Role and to protect privileged accounts. 
<br />
<br />

## Guidance 
When determining how to configure the Global Administrator Role, consider the following proven practices to protect privileged accounts:

- Elevating any users/custom admins to global admins gives them access to all administrative features in Azure AD and Office 365 and the ability to assign admin roles to other users. 

- Leverage non-global administrator roles to perform required administrative work with the least privileges necessary to complete the task. 
- Using roles such as: Password Administrator or Exchange Online Administrator reduce the number of high value, high impact global admin role holders. The reduced number of global admin roles in turn, reduce possibility of a breach of an account having global administrative privileges. 
- Designate alternate roles for global admins so they can complete required tasks using the least privileged permissions. 
- Apply “least privilege” approaches to your administrative model, including:
  - Limit the number of administrators or members of privileged groups
  - Delegate less privileges to accounts (“Just Enough Administration”)
  - Provide privileges on demand (“just in time”). 	
  - Have existing administrators perform tasks instead of adding additional administrators
  - Provide processes for emergency access and rare use scenarios

- Designate **less than five admins (but more than two) global tenant administrators** because the more global admin users you have, the more likely it is that one of those accounts will be successfully breached by an external attacker.
- Ensure you have at least two Global Administrators designated to ensure that you can protect against a rogue insider and to ensure a breach of one of those accounts can be recovered.
- Don’t use generic accounts for Global Administrators. There is no accountability or traceability to an individual and it can be shared.
- Create separate accounts for Global Admin Privileged role members and name them accordingly (e.g. GA-Admin-JSmith for Global Admins).
- Ensure the Global admin accounts you select are managed accounts. i.e. Corporate accounts that are within your Azure AD Tenant or Synced from On-premise AD.
- Create a break glass account ( ensure credentials are vaulted) that can be used in case of emergencies should something occur to Global Admin Accounts
- Review: [Guidance on Securing Azure AD Privileged Identities](3.2.1-Securing-Azure-AD-Privileged-Identities.md).
