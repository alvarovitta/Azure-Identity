# Deploying Site-to-Site VPN to Enable Connectivity to On-Premise ADDS


Use the procedure described in this section to deploy a the Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.

A VPN connection ensures there is connectivity between your on-premise active directory network and the Azure network containing your active directory dependent applications.  

On-premise domain controllers are within the on-premise network. Any application that you move to Azure and, that needs to authenticate to your on-premise infrastructure, requires a site-to-site VPN connection. The VPN connection must exist between the Azure VNet where the applications will reside, and your on-premise Active Directory network.

The figure below represents a Site-to-Site VPN. The VPN connects any of your on-premise systems to any virtual machine or role instance within your Azure virtual network. This type of connection consists of an Azure VPN gateway, an on-premises VPN device, and an IPsec Site-to-Site VPN tunnel connecting the two.

## Guidance

Use the following supplemental information to determine the suitability of this connectivity solution.

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
| With Site-to-Site VPN all traffic is encrypted through the tunnel from your on-premise network to Azure.  | Setting up a site-to-site VPN requires a lot of overhead and effort to set up for the purposes of on-premises connectivity to your on-premise active directory |
| It creates the foundational connectivity that allows you to extend your on-premise domain controllers to Azure.  | You can experience slow and unreliable connections depending on your on-premise internet connectivity.|
| You can use the same site-to-site VPN infrastructure to integrate other services.   | It's possible to experience latency issues with applications that require authentication to on-premise backend systems. |
| Site-to-Site VPN is highly scalable. It is quite easy to add multiple site-to-site connections to your Azure VPN gateway.   ||
| All devices on your on-premises network can communicate with Azure services connected to a VNet so thereâ€™s no need to configure individual connections for each device.  ||



## Preparation 

  1. Before you begin, review following guide to help you [Validate the Types of VPN devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices#devicetable) that are compatible with Azure
	
  2. Before configuring your VPN device, check for any [Known device compatibility issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices#known) for the VPN device that you want to use. 
	
  3. You will need to configure a public-facing IPv4 IP address that is not behind a NAT for your on-premise VPN device
	
  4. Review and determine which VPN type you want to implement: [Path-Based or Route-Based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-plan-design#vpntype). 
	
  5. Review and determine the type of [Gateway SKU](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-plan-design#gwsku) you wish to implement.
	
  6. Ensure to carve out an IP address range that you can use specifically for the virtual network that you will deploy on Azure. If a duplicate address range exists on both sides of the VPN connection, traffic may not route the way you may expect it to.
	
  7. Consider [configuring forced tunnel routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm#configure-forced-tunneling) if your security requirements require you to inspect and audit all internet traffic to and from your Azure network.
	
  8. You will need to come up with a complex Shared Key. This key is required to be configured on your on-premise VPN device and must be the same key when configuring the Site-to-Site VPN connection on Azure.
	
  9. Follow the guide on [How to Create a High Available Cross-Premise Connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-highlyavailable)



## Procedure: How to create a site-to-site VPN

The typical work flow includes the following steps.

Complete steps 1 - 3 using the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal) or [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-create-site-to-site-rm-powershell)

  1. Create and configure an Azure VPN gateway
     Follow the instructions shown:  [Create the VPN gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal#VNetGateway)  (Azure Virtual Network Gateway)
	
  2. Create and configure an Azure local network gateway that represents your on-premises network and VPN device
     Follow the instruction shown: [Create the local network gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal#LocalNetworkGateway)
	
  3. Create and configure an Azure VPN connection between the Azure VPN gateway and the local network gateway
     Follow the instruction shown:  [Create the VPN connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal#CreateConnection)
	 
  4. Configure the on-premises VPN device to establish the S2S VPN tunnel with the Azure VPN gateway
     Use the guidance below to configure your on-premise VPN device. 
	
   - Download a configuration script for your VPN device. The corresponding values of your Azure VPN gateway, virtual network, and on-   
     premises network address prefixes, and VPN connection properties, etc. should already be filled in. Use the script as a starting 
     point. Modify the correct values as needed and deploy it to your on-premise VPN device.
		
        - Follow the instruction shown: [Configure the on-premises VPN device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal#VPNDevice). 
	
        - Follow the instructions on how to use VPM device configuration scripts: [Download the configuration script from Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-download-vpndevicescript#download-the-configuration-script-from-azure-portal) to configure your on-premise VPN devices for Site-to-Site VPN connections to the Azure VPN Gateway.
