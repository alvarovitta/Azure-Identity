| Where does the authentication happen? | On-Premise | On-Premise| In the cloud |
| Where does the user enter the credentials?  | On-premises through proxy in DMZ  |In the cloud transmitted securely to on-premises agent | In the cloud |
| Is there any on-premises infrastructure needed beyond Azure AD Connect?   | Yes, At least 2 ADFS servers and 2 proxies in DMZ |Yes, 1 or more lightweight agents that can be installed on any existing servers (including DCs) with no DMZ requirements | No |
| Do my users get single sign-on to cloud resources from domain-joined devices within company network?  | Yes | Yes | Yes, AAD-join is only supported on Windows 10 (with SSO feature that is in preview or with AAD-join)   |
