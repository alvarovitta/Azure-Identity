# Building Standalone Domain Controllers in Azure

Use the information in this section as guidance when planning to build standalone domain controllers in Azure.

Organizations who do not wish to extend their domain controllers to Azure, can build standalone domains instead in Azure. 

Use this option to build and deploy VMs on Azure and promote them as domain controllers. When you designate the VMs as domain controllers, you create a new AD DS that is separate from that which was built on-premise. The new AD DS will manage the standalone domain controller VMs directly on Azure.

To provide user access to resources in Azure, create user credentials on the new domains. These credentials are stored and maintained on the domain controllers you built and will be separate from the credentials you use to authenticate to your on-premise systems.


|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
|The on-premise active directory infrastructure is completely separate from the domain controllers built on Azure. The isolation of both these infrastructures may be an advantage to your security standards | The end users of your LOBs will require different set of credentials when accessing their applications. Users cannot authenticate to cloud based applications using their on-premise credentials. |
|There is no latency when signing-in to cloud based applications. Users do not have to contact their on-premises domain for authentication to access their cloud based application. Users are able to authenticate directly through Azure.   |Your I.T department will require a different set of "cloud credentials" to login/administer VMs in Azure. |
||You will need to manage the standalone domain controllers on Azure yourself.  |
||Stand-alone domain controllers makes it harder to centralize access management across an organization. It can lead to inconsistent access management policies and can become chaotic if your organization has many users. |
||GPO policies enforced on your on-premise active directory will have to be implemented on standalone domain controllers in Azure. |


## Guidance

Consider using a highly available architecture when deploying domain controllers in Azure. High availability ensures that the topology has failover capabilities to prevent authentication failures to applications that are provisioned in Azure.
