# Extending On-Premise AD Domain Services (AD DS) to Azure
Use the information in this section as guidance when planning to extend on-premises AD Domain Services to Azure.
<br />
<br />

Organizations who have applications that need to be hosted partly on-premises and partly in Azure may need to extend their on-premise AD network to the Azure virtual network. One way to accomplish this is to create a [Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel](4.2-Deploying-Site-to-Site-VPN-to-Enable-Connectivity-to-On-Premise-ADDS.md) between your on-premise network and your Azure virtual network. 

Once the S2S VPN is created, extend your existing on-premises Active Directory infrastructure to Azure. Deploy virtual machines (VMs) that host AD DS in Azure and join the VMs to your on-premises AD forest.
<br />
<br />

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
| Provides access to the same identity information that is available on-premises.  | You must deploy and manage your own AD DS servers and domain in the cloud. |
| You can authenticate user, service, and computer accounts on-premises and in Azure.  | You will need to manage, secure, patch, monitor, backup, and troubleshoot these virtual machines |
| You don't need to manage a separate AD forest. The domain in Azure can belong to the on-premises forest.  | There may be some synchronization latency between the domain servers in the cloud and the servers running on-premises. |	
|You can apply group policy defined by on-premises Group Policy Objects to the domain in Azure. | |

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information.

1. Have a [Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel](4.2-Deploying-Site-to-Site-VPN-to-Enable-Connectivity-to-On-Premise-ADDS.md) configured and in place prior to extending your on-premise infrastructure over to Azure. 
	
2. Configure the DNS on the Azure virtual network to ensure there is connectivity between your organizations on-premises network and your Azure virtual network
	
3. Follow the following recommendations for designing the architecture and infrastructure:
   - [Recommendations on Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/identity/adds-extend-domain#architecture)

   - [Recommendations on Virtual Machines, Networking, Active Directory Site, Monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/identity/adds-extend-domain#recommendations)
<br />
<br />

## Procedure
Extend your on-premise AD network to Azure, see: [Extend AD DS to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/identity/adds-extend-domain#deploy-the-solution).
