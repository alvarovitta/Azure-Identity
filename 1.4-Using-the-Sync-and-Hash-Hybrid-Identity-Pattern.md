# Using the Sync + Hash Hybrid Identity Pattern

Use the Sync + Hash Hybrid Identity Pattern to enable user access to resources for organizations who do not have specific, on-premise or cloud password storage constraints or policies. 

The figure below illustrates the Sync + Hash Hybrid Identity Pattern.

Advantages	Disadvantages
Depending on the resource being accessed, a single password can be used to authenticate users either in the cloud or on-premises.	Although the hash is encrypted, addressed and synchronized in the database, because of regulations, some companies might not be inclined to pursue.
Improved user experience.	
Reduced password-related help-desk support effort and cost	
Does not require any deployment of infrastructure in DMZ, which simplifies the deployment infrastructure when compared with AD FS	
No need for complex infrastructure and no need to store passwords to the cloud	



Guidance
Use the following supplemental information to determine the suitability of this pattern.

	• Users can access Office 365, SaaS applications and other Azure AD-based resources.

	• User identities and associated passwords are synchronized from the on-premises Active Directory to the Azure AD. You must enable synchronization between the Azure AD Synchronization Service (AAD Sync) and the password hash.
	
	• Additionally, you can enable Seamless SSO for users on domain-joined machines that are on the corporate network. With single sign-on, enabled users only need to enter a username to help them securely access cloud resources.
