# Using the Sync + Hash Hybrid Identity Pattern

Use the Sync + Hash Hybrid Identity Pattern to enable user access to resources for organizations who do not have specific, on-premise or cloud password storage constraints or policies. 

The figure below illustrates the Sync + Hash Hybrid Identity Pattern.

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
| Depending on the resource being accessed, a single password can be used to authenticate users either in the cloud or on-premises. |Although the hash is encrypted, addressed and synchronized in the database, because of regulations, some companies might not be inclined to pursue.|
|Improved user experience. | |
|Reduced password-related help-desk support effort and cost | |
|Does not require any deployment of infrastructure in DMZ, which simplifies the deployment infrastructure when compared with AD FS | |
|No need for complex infrastructure and no need to store passwords to the cloud | |



## Guidance

Use the following supplemental information to determine the suitability of this pattern.

- Users can access Office 365, SaaS applications and other Azure AD-based resources.

- User identities and associated passwords are synchronized from the on-premises Active Directory to the Azure AD. You must enable synchronization between the Azure AD Synchronization Service (AAD Sync) and the password hash.
	
- Additionally, you can enable [Seamless SSO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso) for users on domain-joined machines that are on the corporate network. With single sign-on, enabled users only need to enter a username to help them securely access cloud resources.
