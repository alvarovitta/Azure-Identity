# Using the Native Cloud Identity Pattern

Use the Native Cloud Identity Pattern if your organization does not have an existing, on-premise source directory. 
<br />
<br />

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
|Fits the simplest scenario |Degraded user experience|
|No need to synchronize user identities from the on-premises Active Directory domains to the cloud. | Increased password-related help-desk support effort and cost |
| | On-premise and cloud credentials must be manually synchronized. Alternatively, depending on the resource being accessed, different credentials must be used to authenticate the users either in the cloud or on-premises. |
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information to determine the suitability of this pattern.
- Use this pattern only if your organization wishes to use separate user credentials to access cloud or on-premise resources.

- By using this pattern, you can leverage Azure AD as the primary source directory of identities for Azure and Office 365 applications. User identities and associated passwords reside in the cloud and any authentication to cloud applications or resources always occur in the cloud.

After you determine your Identity pattern, select your Implementation pattern. See: [Guidance on Selecting Your Azure AD Authentication Implementation Pattern](1.7-Selecting-your-Azure-AD-Authentication-Implementation-Pattern.md).
