## The Azure AD Identity

Azure AD is Microsoftâ€™s multi-tenant, cloud-based directory and Identity management service. 

An Azure Identity is a user who has an authorized, configured and managed presence in your organization's Azure cloud service subscription. Use Azure AD to manage Identity access and governance as well as application access.

Use the following processes in sequence to design and implement an Azure Identity:

  1. [Planning and Selecting Azure AD Identity Patterns](1.0-Planning-and-Selecting-Azure-AD-Identity-Patterns.md):  Create an Azure AD Identity based on a pattern. An Azure AD Identity pattern is a scenario which closely matches either your existing or required authentication needs. 
	
  2. [Implementing Azure AD Hybrid Identity Patterns](2.0-Implementing-Azure-AD-Hybrid-Identity-Patterns.md):  Implement Azure AD Hybrid Identity patterns. An Azure AD identity pattern is a scenario which closely matches either your existing or required authentication needs.  

  3. [Operationalizing the Hybrid AD Environment](3.0-Operationalizing-the-Hybrid-AD-Environment.md): Use the information in this section to bring your Hybrid AD environment into a fully operational state.
	
  4. [Migrating Directory Services Aware Applications to Azure](4.0-Migrating-Directory-Services-Aware-Applications-to-Azure.md):  Install management software and configure the Identities for your organization.
