# Objects and Attributes to Synchronize to Azure AD

Use the guidance provided in this section to understand which objects and attributes to synchronize to the Azure Active Directory.

|**Attribute Requirement** | **Guidance** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
|Attributes to synchronize | Synchronize objects based on common populated attribute: <br /> <br />
- Recommended: Synchronize objects that you want to sync based on a common attribute that is populated across all objects (e.g. O365sync) . Ensure you select an AD attribute that is not in use. <br /><br /> - Synchronization of objects based on Group Memberships is not recommended for production environments because it impacts server  performance significantly. <br /.<br /> - Synchronization of OUs is not practical because most organizations spread their AD objects across hundreds of OUs |
|Attributes that contain sensitive or PII data  | - Compile a list of attributes that contain sensitive or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data. <br/><br/> - During installation, deselect the attributes using:  [Azure AD app and attribute filtering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom#azure-ad-app-and-attribute-filtering).  |
