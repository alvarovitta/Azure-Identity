# Planning Azure AD Roles


Azure AD Roles help your organization designate administrators to serve different functions. In Azure AD, these administrators have access to various features. Depending on their administrator role they can create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, and manage domains, among other things. 

A user who is assigned an administrator role will have the same permissions across all of the cloud services to which your organization has subscribed to, regardless of whether you assign the role in the Office 365 portal, or in the Azure portal, or by using the Azure AD module for Windows PowerShell.



Guidance
Use the following guidance to help kick-start your planning process:

	• Start planning the roles as described in: Top 5 Azure AD RBAC roles.

	• When planning Azure AD roles, compile a list of users or groups who require access. Using the list, identify the Azure AD role assignment for each user/group.

	• Use a Least Privileged Access model. Implementing this model will ensure that you allocate sufficient privileges to accomplish specified functions, but no more. For more information, see: Governing Azure AD Global Admin Role.
	
	• Minimize the number of people that are Global Administrators. For more information, see Governing Azure AD Global Admin Role.
	
	• Implement Just in time administration and manage roles using Azure AD PIM. For more information, see: Securing Azure AD Privileged Identities.
