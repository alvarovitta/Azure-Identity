# Selecting the User Principal Name Attribute in Azure AD

Use the guidance provided in this section to select the User Principal Name (UPN) attribute in Azure AD.

The default UPN suffix is the DNS name of the domain in which the user account is created. In most cases, this is the domain name that's registered as the enterprise domain on the Internet. 

  - Add more UPN suffixes by using Active Directory Domains and Trusts.
  
  - By default, the Azure AD Connect wizard uses the userPrincipalName attribute. For custom installations, the wizard prompts you to specify the attribute to be used from on-premises as the user principal name in Azure AD. This attribute value is used for signing-in to Azure AD. If the value of the userPrincipalName attribute doesn't correspond to a verified domain in Azure AD, then Azure AD replaces it with a default .onmicrosoft.com value.
	
  - To let you get started using Azure or other Microsoft services, every directory in Azure Active Directory has a built-in domain name, with the format: contoso.onmicrosoft.com. You can improve and simplify the sign-in experience by using custom domains. For information on custom domain names in Azure AD and how to verify a domain, see [Add your custom domain name to Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/add-custom-domain#add-the-custom-domain-name-to-your-directory).


## Guidance: Selecting the user principal name attribute in Azure AD

  - Users use the userPrincipalName attribute when signing-in to Azure AD and Office 365. Verify the domains (also known as UPN suffixes) that are used in Azure AD before the users are synchronized.

  - Strongly recommend that you keep the default attribute userPrincipalName. If this attribute is nonroutable and can't be verified, then it's possible to select another attribute (email, for example) as the attribute that holds the sign-in ID. This is known as the Alternate ID. The Alternate ID attribute value must follow the RFC 822 standard. You can use an Alternate ID with both password SSO and federation SSO as the sign-in solution.

  - Using an Alternate ID isn't compatible with all Office 365 workloads. For more information, see [Configuring Alternate Login ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configuring-alternate-login-id).

## Guidance:  Using AD FS federation
	
  - You cannot create a federation with the default .onmicrosoft.com domain in Azure AD or an unverified custom domain in Azure AD. 

  - Using the Azure AD Connect wizard:  If you select an unverified domain to create a federation, Azure AD Connect prompts you to create the necessary records where your DNS is hosted for the domain. For more information, see [Verify the Azure AD domain selected for federation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom#verify-the-azure-ad-domain-selected-for-federation).

  - If you selected the Federation with AD FS user sign-in option:  You must have a custom domain to continue creating a federation in Azure AD. For example, this means you must add a custom domain (contoso.com) in the Azure AD directory.
