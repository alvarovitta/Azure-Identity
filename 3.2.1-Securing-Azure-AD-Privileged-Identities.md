# Securing Azure AD Privileged Identities
This section describes design considerations and proven practices when securing Azure AD privileged identities.

For further information on Privileged Accounts, see:  [What is Azure AD Privileged Identity Management?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure)
<br />

## Guidance
Use the following as guidelines when applying governance to privileged accounts:
	
  - Do not use generic accounts because there is no accountability or traceability to person and it can be shared
	
  - Create separate accounts for Privileged role members and name them accordingly (e.g. GA-Admin-JSmith for Global Admins)
	
  - Have a minimum of two and a maximum of five subscription owners (service admins and co-admins) to prevent collusion while preventing admin sprawl
	
  - Ensure the admin accounts you select are managed accounts. i.e. Corporate accounts that are within your Azure AD Tenant or Synced from On-premise AD.
	
  - Ensure Admin Accounts can only be accessed via an enforceable, automated workflow approval process which requires an approver who is different from the requestor.
	
  - Ensure privileged role assignment is not assigned permanently but on a just in time basis.
	
  - Enforce Multi-Factor authentication and risk-based conditional access on admin accounts.
	
  - Implement Azure AD [PIM (Privileged Identity Management)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure) across Admin Accounts and privileged azure roles to enforce just-in-time administration.
	
  - Implement Periodic (Quarterly) Admin Account Access Review to re-certify who should continue to have access to admin and should be different from the Role Owner.
	
  - Monitor via real-time alerts when members are added or removed from privilege roles.
	 
  - Enable > Medium Risk Conditional Policy rule using [Azure AD Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-enable) to protect Admin Accounts (based on privileged account members belonging to an Azure AD Group).
	
  - Configure [Conditional Access Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-locations) to ensure privileged accounts can only logging from trusted networks.
	
  - Use a [Hardened Admin Workstation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-management#client-configuration) when logging on with privileged accounts to Azure.

**Design considerations**:
  - Azure AD [PIM (Privileged Identity Management)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure) requires Azure AD premium P2 licenses or EMS (Enterprise Mobility Suite) E5 licenses. 
	
  - Azure AD [Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-enable) requires [Azure AD premium P2 licenses](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) or [EMS (Enterprise Mobility Suite) E5 licenses](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security-pricing).
