# Enabling Top 10 Security Alerts to Monitor Azure AD
Use the guidance in this section when planning to configure the security alert notifications.
<br />
<br />

Security alerts provide you with the ability to monitor, track and audit your Azure AD (AAD) tenants. By implementing security alerts you will be notified almost immediately when specific changes have been made to your Azure AD. 

Change condition examples:
- new users added to AAD
- user passwords changed
- users removed from AAD
- policies that have changed
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
Use the following recommended top foundational security alerts to configure Azure AD tenants:
1.  Member added to or removed from Global Admin Role
	
2.  Custom Domain added/removed in AAD tenant
3.  Deleted users or groups from tenant
4.  Password changed or reset for Global Admin Role
5.  Assign or remove 3rd party authentication provider
6.  Sync Status Enabled/Disabled
7.  Authentication Status Changes:
    - Federation Status Enabled/Disabled
    - Password Sync Enabled/Disabled
    - Seamless Single Sign-on Enabled /Disabled
    - Pass thru Authentication Enabled/Disabled
8.  Global Admin Can Manage Azure Subscriptions Setting Change (Yes/No)
9.  Conditional Access Policy Enabled/Disabled/Changed
10.  Multi-Factor Status enabled/Disabled for Privileged Azure AD Roles
