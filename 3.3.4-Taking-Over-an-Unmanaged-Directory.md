# Taking Over an Unmanaged Directory
Use the information in this section when planning on how to take over an unmanaged directory.
<br />
<br />

An unmanaged directory is a directory that creates self-service identities and has no Global Administrator. 

There are two ways to take over an unmanaged directory:

1. **Internal Admin Take Over**:  
  You are added as the Global Administrator of the unmanaged directory. No users, domains, or service plans are migrated to any other directory you administer.

2. **External Admin Take Over**:  
  You add the DNS domain name of the unmanaged directory to your managed Azure directory. When you add the domain name, a map of users-to-resources is created in your managed Azure directory and users can continue to access services without interruption.
