# Taking Over an Unmanaged Directory


Use the information in this section when planning on how to take over an unmanaged directory.

An unmanaged directory is a directory that creates self-service identities and has no global administrator. 

There are two ways to take over an unmanaged directory:

	1. Internal Admin Take Over: With an internal admin take over, you are added as the global administrator of the unmanaged directory. No users, domains, or service plans are migrated to any other directory you administer.
	2. External Admin Take Over: With an external admin take over, you add the DNS domain name of the unmanaged directory to your managed Azure directory. When you add the domain name, a mapping of users to resources is created in your managed Azure directory so that users can continue to access services without interruption.
