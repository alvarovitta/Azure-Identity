# Implementing ADFS Server 2016 for Azure AD

Use the procedure described in this section to implement ADFS Server 2016 for Azure AD. 


## Guidance

  - Use the following guides to plan a secure AD FS deployment:
    - [Core Security Practices for AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/design/best-practices-for-secure-planning-and-deployment-of-ad-fs#core-security-best-practices-for-ad-fs)
    - [SQL Server Specific Best Practices for AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/design/best-practices-for-secure-planning-and-deployment-of-ad-fs#sql-serverspecific-security-best-practices-for-ad-fs)
	
  - AD FS and Web Application Proxy hardware requirements are gated on CPU; size your farm for processing capacity.
	
  - Whether you deploy AD FS on on-premise or on Azure, have a high-available AD FS infrastructure. Build two AD FS servers and two Web Application Proxy (WAP) servers (in the DMZ). Use one AD FS Server and one WAP Server as the primary active node. Use one ADFS and one WAP server as a secondary node in passive/staging mode.
	
  - For deployment of AD FS on-premises, use the standard deployment topology as described in:  [Best practices for securing Active Directory Federation Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#standard-deployment-topology).


## Preparation 

Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 

  1. If you have AD FS already implemented on-premise, skip the next steps below. Use the custom installation of Azure AD Connect, see: [Configuring federation with AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom#configuring-federation-with-ad-fs)
  
  2. If you have AD FS implemented on Windows Server 2012 and wish to upgrade to Windows Server 2016, use: [Upgrade to AD FS in Windows Server 2016](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/upgrading-to-ad-fs-in-windows-server#to-upgrade-your-ad-fs-farm-to-windows-server-2016-farm-behavior-level)
	
  3. If you do not have AD FS implemented, refer to the requirements and prerequisites, see: [AD FS Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/overview/ad-fs-requirements).

  4. Check the [Ports Required](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#ports-required) prior to deploying AD FS.
	
  5. Configure your firewall to connect to Office 365: [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2)



## Procedure:  How to implement ADFS Server 2016 in Azure

Use one of the following to deploy AD FS Server 2016:

  - Deploy AD FS Server 2016 on-premise, use the following checklist:  [Deploy AD FS on-premise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/deploying-a-federation-server-farm). 

  - To deploy AD FS Server 2016 in Azure AD, use the following guide:  [Deploy AD FS in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-azure-adfs#steps-to-deploy-ad-fs-in-azure).
