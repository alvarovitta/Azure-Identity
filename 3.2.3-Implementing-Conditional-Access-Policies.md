# Implementing Conditional Access Policies
This section describes design considerations and proven practices when implementing conditional access policies.
<br />
<br />

Use Azure AD conditional access to enforce control on access to applications in your environment. Access is based on specific conditions from a central location. As your organization's business, security and compliance requirements evolve, so will your conditional access policies.

The following are the three most common access concerns that conditional access can help resolve:  

1. [Sign-in risk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-conditions#sign-in-risk):  
   Azure AD Identity Protection detects sign-in risks.   
   - How do you restrict access if a detected sign-in indicates a bad actor? 
   - How do you obtain evidence that a sign-in was performed by a legitimate user?

2. [Network location](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-locations):  
   Azure AD is accessible from anywhere.
   - What if an access attempt is performed from a network location that is not under the control of your IT department? Using a username and password combination may be adequate proof of identity for access attempts to your resources from your corporate network. 
   - What if you require strong proof of identity for access attempts that originate from unexpected countries or regions? 
   - What if you want to block access attempts from certain locations? 

3. [Device management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-conditions#device-platforms):  
  In Azure AD, users can access cloud applications using a broad range of devices including mobile and personal devices. 
   - Do you require access using devices that are managed only by your IT department? 
   - Do you want to block certain device types from accessing cloud applications in your environment?

## Guidance 
Use the following as guidelines when implementing conditional access:  
- Obtain an Azure AD Premium license. To find the right license for your requirements, see [Comparing generally available features of the Free, Basic, and Premium editions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/).

- Review the list of applications that work with conditional access policies, see: [Applications and browsers that use conditional access rules in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-technical-reference).
- Review policy requirements: [Conditional Access > Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-best-practices#what-you-should-know) 
- Review assignment trigger conditions: [Conditional Access > How are assignments evaluated?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-best-practices#what-you-should-know)
- Review conditional access policy functionality:  [Conditional Access Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal#conditional-access-policies).
- Evaluate your policy using the:  [What-if Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-whatif). Use this tool to evaluate the effect of a policy on your environment before you deploy the policy.
- When you are ready to deploy a new policy into your environment, perform the following in phases:  
  - Apply a policy to a small set of users and verify it behaves as expected. 
  - When you expand a policy to include more users, continue to exclude all administrators from the policy. This ensures that administrators still have access and can update a policy if a change is required.
  - Apply a policy to all users only if absolutely required. 
- Create a user account that is:
  - Dedicated to policy administration 
  - Excluded from all your policies
	
   - To avoid undesirable results, review each configuration policy before deploying to your environment: [Best Practices > What you should avoid doing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-best-practices#what-you-should-avoid-doing)
