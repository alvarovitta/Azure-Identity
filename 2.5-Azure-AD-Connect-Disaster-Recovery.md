# Azure AD Connect Disaster Recovery
Use the information in this section to help plan for recovery and restoration of Azure AD Connect services in case there is a link failure to your sync server. Plan your recovery strategy in the infrastructure and implementation design phase
<br />
<br />

A disaster condition occurs when you lose connectivity or access to the sync server. Your recovery strategy depends on your organization's tolerance to loss of service during downtime.

During link downtime, the following may occur:

  - Inability to make changes to objects in Azure AD
	
  - Loss of password synchronization. Users may need to use an old password in Azure AD should the on-premises password change. 
	
  - Interruption to operations that take place in real-time, for example: password writeback
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
The recovery model that best fits your needs depends on your tolerance level to downtime operating conditions (listed above) and your organizationâ€™s policies. 

Consider the following recovery strategies:

- Rebuild when needed: 
  Install the sync engine on a spare server. Perform an initial import and sync within few hours. If you don't have a spare server, you   can use a domain controller to temporarily host the sync engine.
		
- Implement Azure AD Connect in Staging Mode, see: [Azure AD Connect in Staging Mode](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Azure-Identity/blob/master/2.6-Running-Azure-AD-Connect-in-Staging-Mode.md).

- Use virtual machines:
  Run the sync engine on a virtual machine. If the host has problems, the image with the sync engine server can be migrated to another     server.

- Implement SQL high availability:
   - Use a dedicated SQL Server that supports SQL clustering and AOA (Always-On-Availability groups). Enable SQL AOA before installing Azure AD Connect. 
		
  - During installation, Azure AD Connect detects if the SQL instance is enabled for SQL AOA. If SQL AOA is enabled, Azure AD Connect determines if it is configured for synchronous replication or asynchronous replication. 
		
  - When setting up the Availability Group Listener, set the RegisterAllProvidersIP property to 0. Azure AD Connect currently uses SQL Native Client to connect to SQL.  SQL Native Client does not support use of the MultiSubNetFailover property.
