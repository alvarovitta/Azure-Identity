# Implementing Azure AD Connect Server
Use the mandatory procedure described in this section to install and configure Azure AD Connect. 
<br />
<br />

Use Azure AD Connect to synchronize your on-premise directories with the Azure Active Directory. Once the directories are synchronized, end-users can seamlessly access both cloud and on-premises resources.  
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
Use the following supplemental information when performing this procedure:
- If you expect your database to be larger than 10GB or you have more than 100K objects in AD, use SQL standard or enterprise (not SQL express).

- Use at least two Azure AD Connect servers:  One is the active server,  the other is operating in staging mode. 
- Do not co-host Azure AD connect server with other Sync engines on the same server (such as FIM/MIM).
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 
1. Download Azure AD Connect (Version  1.1.486.0 or later). Access the Azure Connect software download center:  [Azure AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594).
	
2. Complete the prerequisite steps using the procedure described in: [Prerequisites for Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-prerequisites)  
	
3. Obtain the required accounts and permissions. Refer to:  [Azure AD Connect: Accounts and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions). 
	
4. If you already have AD FS implemented on-premises, use the custom installation of Azure AD Connect. Follow the steps described in:      [Configuring federation with AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom#ad-fs-configuration-pre-requisites).
	
5. If you have ADFS implemented on Windows Server 2012 and want to upgrade to Windows Server 2016, use the following guide:  [Upgrade to AD FS in Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/upgrading-to-ad-fs-in-windows-server-sql#moving-from-a-windows-server-2012-r2-ad-fs-farm-to-a-windows-server-2016-ad-fs-farm).
	
  6. Configure your firewall to connect to Office 365, see: [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2).
	
  7. If you have an existing Azure AD tenant, refer to: [Azure AD Connect: When you have an existent tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-existing-tenant).
	
  8. Review [Supported Topologies for Azure AD connect Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-topologies). 
<br />
<br />

## Procedure:  How to install and configure Azure AD Connect 
Use this procedure to install and configure Azure AD Connect. 

1. **Run the Azure AD executable file**   
    Once you download **AzureADConnect.msi** as instructed in the preparation, navigate to the download folder, locate the .msi file, right-click it and select: “run as administrator”.
	
2. **Perform a custom installation**   
   Follow the steps to Install using Custom settings (Recommended):  [Custom installation of Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom).
	
3. **Verify Azure AD Connect is installed correctly**   
   Once Azure AD Connect is installed, verify the installation and assign licenses. See: [Next steps and how to manage Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-whats-next).
