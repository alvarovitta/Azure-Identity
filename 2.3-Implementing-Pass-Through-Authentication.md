# Implementing Pass-Through Authentication

Use the procedure described in this section to implement Pass-Through Authentication.  

Guidance
	• To avoid user sign-in failures, configure Pass-through Authentication for high availability. Consider installing two to three  authentication agents for high availability and capacity. 
	
	• Install authentication agents close to your domain controllers to improve sign-in latency.
	
	• Consider implementing password writeback on your on-premises active directory so that if a user signs in by using Pass-through Authentication, they can change or reset their passwords. The passwords are written back to the on-premises Active Directory as expected.



Preparation Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  
	1. Check the prerequisites for the Azure Active Directory Admin centre.
	
	2. Check the prerequisites for your on-premises environment.



Procedure:  Enable pass-through authentication through Azure AD ConnectPerform the activities in this procedure:
	1. Enable Pass-through authentication in Azure. 
	Perform the step as described in: Enable the Feature.
	
	2. Verify correct implementation of pass-through authentication. 
	Perform the step as described in: Test the Feature.
