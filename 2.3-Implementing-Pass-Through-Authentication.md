# Implementing Pass-Through Authentication

Use the procedure described in this section to implement Pass-Through Authentication. 

## Guidance

- To avoid user sign-in failures, configure Pass-through Authentication for [high availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#step-5-ensure-high-availability). Consider installing two to three  authentication agents for high availability and capacity. 
	
- Install authentication agents close to your domain controllers to improve sign-in latency.
	
- Consider implementing password writeback on your on-premises active directory so that if a user signs in by using Pass-through Authentication, they can change or reset their passwords. The passwords are written back to the on-premises Active Directory as expected.


## Preparation 

Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  
	
 1. Check the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#in-the-azure-active-directory-admin-center) for the Azure Active Directory Admin centre.
	
 2. Check the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#in-your-on-premises-environment) for your on-premises environment.


## Procedure:  Enable pass-through authentication through Azure AD ConnectPerform the activities in this procedure:
	
  1. Enable Pass-through authentication in Azure. 
     Perform the step as described in: [Enable the Feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#step-3-enable-the-feature).
	
  2. Verify correct implementation of pass-through authentication. 
     Perform the step as described in: [Test the Feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#step-4-test-the-feature).
