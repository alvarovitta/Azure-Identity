# Using the Sync + Pass-thru Authentication Hybrid Identity Pattern

Use the Sync + Pass-thru Authentication Hybrid Identity Pattern for organizations with security and compliance policy restrictions. 

The figure below illustrates user access to cloud services via pass-through authentication: 

	• With pass-through authentication, user passwords are validated against the on-premises Active Directory controller. 

	• While validation of access to cloud services occurs, the process evaluates on-premises policies, such as sign-in hour restrictions.

	• Pass-through authentication uses a simple agent on a Windows Server 2012 R2 domain-joined machine in the on-premises environment. This agent monitors password validation requests. The server doesn't require any inbound ports to be open to the Internet.

Advantages	Disadvantages
Depending on the resource being accessed, you can use the same password to authenticate the user either in the cloud or on-premises.	Requires use of a Pass-through authentication agent in addition to AAD Sync.
Improved user experience	Additional agents are required on multiple on-premises servers to provide high availability for sign-in requests
Reduced password-related help-desk support effort and cost	Various unsupported scenarios (see below)
Users can complete self-service password management tasks in the cloud	
Integration with Azure AD Conditional Access policies, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and filtering out brute-force password attacks.	
Simplified on-premises deployments	



Guidance
Use the following supplemental information to determine the suitability of this pattern.

Supported scenarios	Unsupported scenarios
User sign-ins to all web browser-based applications	Detection of users with leaked credentials.
User sign-ins to Office applications that support Modern authentication: Office 2016, and Office 2013 with modern authentication	User sign-in to Skype for Business client applications without modern authentication.
User sign-ins to Skype for Business that support modern authentication, including Online & Hybrid topologies.  Learn more about supported topologies here.	User sign-in to PowerShell version 1.0 (recommend PowerShell version 2.0).
Azure AD domain joins for Windows 10 devices	App passwords for Multi-Factor Authentication.
Exchange ActiveSync support	User sign-in to legacy Office client applications: Office 2010, and Office 2013 without modern authentication. 
	
	Organizations are encouraged to switch to modern authentication if possible. Modern authentication allows for Pass-through authentication support. 
	
	Modern authentication also helps secure your user accounts by using conditional access features, such as Azure Multi-Factor Authentication.
	Azure AD Domain Services needs Password Hash Synchronization to be enabled on the tenant. Therefore tenants that use Pass-through Authentication only don't work for scenarios that need Azure AD Domain Services.
	Pass-through Authentication is not integrated with Azure AD Connect Health.
	The Apple Device Enrollment Program (Apple DEP) does not support modern authentication. Apple DEP devices will fail to enroll into Intune for domains using Pass-through Authentication.
	Important:  As a workaround for unsupported scenarios only, enable Password Hash Synchronization on the  Optional features page in the Azure AD Connect wizard. 
	
	Note:  Enabling password hash synchronization gives you the option to failover authentication if your on-premises infrastructure is disrupted. This failover from Pass-through Authentication to Active Directory password hash synchronization is not automatic. You'll need to switch the sign-in method manually using Azure AD Connect. If the server running Azure AD Connect goes down, you'll require help from Microsoft Support to turn off Pass-through Authentication.
