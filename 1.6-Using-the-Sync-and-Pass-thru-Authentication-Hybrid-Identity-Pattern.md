# Using the Sync + Pass-thru Authentication Hybrid Identity Pattern

Use the Sync + Pass-thru Authentication Hybrid Identity Pattern for organizations with security and compliance policy restrictions. 

The figure below illustrates user access to cloud services via pass-through authentication: 

- With pass-through authentication, user passwords are validated against the on-premises Active Directory controller. 

- While validation of access to cloud services occurs, the process evaluates on-premises policies, such as sign-in hour restrictions.

- Pass-through authentication uses a simple agent on a Windows Server 2012 R2 domain-joined machine in the on-premises environment. This agent monitors password validation requests. The server doesn't require any inbound ports to be open to the Internet.

|**Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
|Depending on the resource being accessed, you can use the same password to authenticate the user either in the cloud or on-premises. |Requires use of a Pass-through authentication agent in addition to AAD Sync.|
|Improved user experience |Implement all complex logic with PowerShell Workflow code.| Additional agents are required on multiple on-premises servers to provide high availability for sign-in requests |
|Reduced password-related help-desk support effort and cost |Various unsupported scenarios (see below) |
|Users can complete self-service password management tasks in the cloud ||
|Integration with Azure AD Conditional Access policies, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and filtering out brute-force password attacks. ||
|Simplified on-premises deployments ||



## Guidance

Use the following supplemental information to determine the suitability of this pattern.


|**Supported Scenarios** | **Unsupported Scenarios** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
|User sign-ins to all web browser-based applications |Detection of users with [leaked credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-risk-events#leaked-credentials).|
|User sign-ins to Office applications that support [Modern authentication](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/using-office-365-modern-authentication-with-office-clients-776c0036-66fd-41cb-8928-5495c0f9168a): Office 2016, and Office 2013 with modern authentication | User sign-in to Skype for Business client applications without modern authentication. 
|User sign-ins to Skype for Business that support modern authentication, including Online & Hybrid topologies.  Learn more about supported topologies [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/modern-authentication/topologies-supported). |User sign-in to PowerShell version 1.0 (recommend PowerShell version 2.0). |
| Azure AD domain joins for Windows 10 devices |App passwords for Multi-Factor Authentication. |
| Exchange ActiveSync support |User sign-in to legacy Office client applications: Office 2010, and Office 2013 without modern authentication.  <br/><br/> Organizations are encouraged to switch to modern authentication if possible. Modern authentication allows for Pass-through authentication support. <br/><br/> Modern authentication also helps secure your user accounts by using [conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal) features, such as Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. |
||Azure AD Domain Services needs Password Hash Synchronization to be enabled on the tenant. Therefore tenants that use Pass-through Authentication only don't work for scenarios that need Azure AD Domain Services. |
||Pass-through Authentication is not integrated with [Azure AD Connect Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect-health/active-directory-aadconnect-health). |
||The Apple Device Enrollment Program (Apple DEP) does not support modern authentication. Apple DEP devices will fail to enroll into Intune for domains using Pass-through Authentication. |
||**Important:**  As a workaround for unsupported scenarios only, enable Password Hash Synchronization on the  Optional features page in the Azure AD Connect wizard. <br/><br/>  **Note:**  Enabling password hash synchronization gives you the option to failover authentication if your on-premises infrastructure is disrupted. This failover from Pass-through Authentication to Active Directory password hash synchronization is not automatic. You'll need to switch the sign-in method manually using Azure AD Connect. If the server running Azure AD Connect goes down, you'll require help from Microsoft Support to turn off Pass-through Authentication. |
