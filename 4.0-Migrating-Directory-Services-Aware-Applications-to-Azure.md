# Migrating Directory Services Aware Applications to Azure


Use the guidance provided in this section to plan to migrate Directory Services (DS) aware applications to Azure.  

A key aspect of migrating on-premises applications to Azure is handling the identity needs of these applications. 

Directory Services aware applications may rely on Light weight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for read or write access to the corporate directory. Alternatively, the DS aware applications rely on Windows Integrated Authentication (Kerberos or NTLM authentication) to authenticate end users. 

Line-of-business (LOB) applications running on Windows Server are typically deployed on domain-joined machines so they can be managed securely using Group Policy. To 'lift-and-shift' on-premises applications to the cloud, the dependencies on the corporate identity infrastructure need to be resolved.



## Guidance

Administrators can apply one of the following solutions to satisfy the identity needs of their applications deployed in Azure:

  - [Configuring Azure AD Domain Services in Azure Tenant](4.1-Configuring-Azure-AD-Domain-Services-in-Azure-Tenant.md):  Azure AD DS provides managed domain services such as: domain join, group policy and Kerberos/NTLM authentication. 
	
  - [Deploying Site-to-Site VPN to Enable Connectivity to On-Premise AD DS](4.2-Deploying-Site-to-Site-VPN-to-Enable-Connectivity-to-On-Premise-ADDS.md):  Use the procedure described in this section to deploy a the Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.
	
  - [Extending On-Premise AD Domain Services (AD DS) to Azure](4.3-Extending-On-Premise-AD-Domain-Services-(AD-DS)-to-Azure.md):  Use the information as guidance when planning to extend on-premises AD Domain Services to Azure.
	
  - [Building Standalone Domain Controllers](4.4-Building-Standalone-Domain-Controllers-in-Azure.md): Use the information as guidance when planning to build standalone domain controllers in Azure.




## Next steps

The following section details advantages and disadvantages of each of these design patterns to help you select the design that best suits your organizations compliance, security and operational requirements needs.
