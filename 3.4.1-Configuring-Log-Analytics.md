3. **Configure OMS for log analytics**   
  See: [Configuring OMS for Log Analytics](3.4.2-Configuring-OMS-for-Log-Analytics.md) 
	
4. **Create alerts with log analytics**    
  Create alerts:

   - when certain events are created
   - in the absence of an event
   - when a number of events are created within a particular time window

   [Create alerts with log analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-tutorial-response#create-alerts) using the [Top 10 Queries for Azure Active Directory](/alvarovitta/Azure-Identity/blob/master/3.4.3-Top-10-Queries-for-Azure-Active-Directory.md)
