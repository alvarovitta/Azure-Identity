# Implementing Azure AD Hybrid Identity Patterns
Use the information in this section to implement the Azure AD Hybrid Identity patterns.
<br />
<br />

An Azure AD identity pattern is a scenario which closely matches either your existing or required authentication needs. Use the pattern which best fits your requirements. 

For summary information on how to select your Azure AD authentication pattern, see:  [Selecting Your Azure AD Authentication](1.7-Selecting-your-Azure-AD-Authentication-Implementation-Pattern.md) Implementation Pattern.
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
For information when considering an Identity and authentication pattern, see:  [Determine your Directory Synchronization requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-hybrid-identity-design-considerations-directory-sync-requirements).

## Next steps
Use the following implementation procedures:
  - [Implementing Azure AD Connect Server](2.1-Implementing-Azure-AD-Connect-Server.md):  Mandatory procedure. Use Azure AD Connect to synchronize your on-premise directories with Azure Active Directory so ends users can seamlessly access both cloud and on-premise resources.

  - [Implementing AD FS Server for Azure AD](2.2-Implementing-ADFS-Server-2016-for-Azure-AD.md):  Optional. Use one of two procedures to deploy AD FS Server 2016 in Azure AD or on-premises.

  - [Implementing Pass-Through Authentication](2.3-Implementing-Pass-Through-Authentication.md): Optional. Use the procedure described in this section to implement Pass-Through Authentication.

  - [Implementing Password-Hash Synchronization](2.3-Implementing-Pass-Through-Authentication.md): Optional. Use the procedure described in this section to implement Password hash synchronization.

  - [Azure AD Connect Disaster Recovery](2.5-Azure-AD-Connect-Disaster-Recovery.md): Use the information in this section to help plan for recovery and restoration of Azure AD Connect services in case there is a link failure to your sync server. 

  - [Running Azure AD Connect in Staging Mode](2.6-Running-Azure-AD-Connect-in-Staging-Mode.md):  Use procedure described in this section to install, configure and run Azure AD Connect Sync in Staging Mode.
