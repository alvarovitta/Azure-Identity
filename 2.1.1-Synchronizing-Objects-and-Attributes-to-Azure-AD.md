# Synchronizing Objects and Attributes to Azure AD

Use the guidance provided in this section to understand which objects and attributes to synchronize to the Azure Active Directory.

|**Attribute Requirement** | **Guidance** |  
| -------------| -------------| 
|Attributes to synchronize | Synchronize objects based on common populated attribute: <br/><br/> **Recommended**: Synchronize objects that you want to sync based on a common attribute that is populated across all objects (e.g. O365sync) . Ensure you select an AD attribute that is not in use. <br/><br/> • Synchronization of objects based on Group Memberships is not recommended for production environments because it impacts server  performance significantly. <br/><br/> • Synchronization of OUs is not practical because most organizations spread their AD objects across hundreds of OUs |
|Attributes that contain sensitive or PII data  | • Compile a list of attributes that contain sensitive or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data. <br/><br/> • During installation, deselect the attributes using:  [Azure AD app and attribute filtering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom#azure-ad-app-and-attribute-filtering).  |
|Attribute selection |  • Depending on the services you are consuming, refer to the following links to determine the attributes that you need to synchronize to Azure AD: <br/><br/>  • [Office 365 ProPlus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-attributes-synchronized#office-365-proplus) <br/>  • [Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-attributes-synchronized#exchange-online) <br/> • [SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-attributes-synchronized#sharepoint-online) <br/> • [Lync Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-attributes-synchronized#lync-online-subsequently-known-as-skype-for-business) <br/> • [Dynamics CRM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-attributes-synchronized#dynamics-crm) |
