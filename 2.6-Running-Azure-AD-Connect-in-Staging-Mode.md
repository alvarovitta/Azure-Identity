# Running Azure AD Connect in Staging Mode
Use the procedure described in this section to install, configure and run Azure AD Connect Sync in Staging Mode.
<br />
<br />

Use Staging Mode to make and preview changes to configuration before you make the Azure AD Connect server active. Use Staging Mode to determine the effects a configuration change will have on your operating environment. 

When installing Azure AD connect, you can enable Staging Mode as an option. By using this option, the Azure AD Connect server can import and synchronize but will not run any exports. You can force an export by using the synchronization service manager.

Use Staging Mode under the following conditions:

  - Using High Availability
  - Testing and deploying new configuration changes
  - Introducing a new server and decommissioning the old
	
A server operating in Staging Mode, continues to receive changes from Active Directory and Azure AD. The server always has a copy of the latest changes and can quickly assume the responsibilities of another server. If you make configuration changes to your primary server, make the same changes to your Staging Mode server.
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
Use a separate database when configuring a server to run in Staging Mode. The Staging Mode server requires a separate database from that used the Azure AD Connect server.

## Procedure:  How to Install and Configure in Staging Mode
Use this procedure to verify the configuration of an Azure AD Connect server in Staging Mode:

  1. Install Azure AD Connect in Staging Mode
     See: [Prepare](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations#prepare).

  2. Compare the Primary and Staging server configurations
     See: [Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations#configuration)
	
  3. Export changes to Azure AD and on-premises AD
     See: [Import and Synchronize](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations#import-and-synchronize)
	
  4. Verify the changes before you export
     See: [Verify](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations#verify).
	
  5. Switch operation to the Staging server
     See: [Switch active server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations#switch-active-server)
