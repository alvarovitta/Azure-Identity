# Determining Requirements for the Hybrid Identity Solution
Determine the Identity requirements your business organization will be using to leverage the hybrid identity solution. Use the Azure AD hybrid identity solution to synchronize on-premises directory objects with Azure AD while still managing users on-premises.
<br />
<br />

Accurate evaluation of the identity requirements will help define the capabilities your lines of business require to enhance workloads. The workloads or services that you adopt for users of your lines of business will dictate the requirements for the hybrid identity design.

As a starting point, engage your lines of businesses to understand their current and future key business needs and requirements. If you don't have a clear understanding of the requirements at the beginning of the design phase, the solution you implement may not be scalable as your needs expand.
