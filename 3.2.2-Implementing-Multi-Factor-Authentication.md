# Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication
This section describes design considerations and proven practices when implementing Multi-Factor Authentication.
<br />
<br />

Two-stage verification is an authentication method requiring end users to implement a second layer of verification upon sign-ins. 

Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Microsoft's two-step verification solution. Azure MFA provides a range of verification methods that include phone call, text message or mobile app verification.

Use one of the following two methods to implement MFA:
	
   1. [MFA in the Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted)
   2. [MFA on-premises](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfaserver-deploy)
<br />
<br />

## Guidance 
Use the following as guidelines when implementing MFA:
   - Ensure you have licenses for Azure MFA, Azure AD Premium or Enterprise Mobility and Security. If you do not have licenses, create an Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Provider to take full advantage of the features provided by Azure MFA. Review  the following guides on how to create and manage an MFA provider: 
        -  [Create an MFA Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-authprovider#create-an-mfa-provider) 
        -  [Manage your MFA Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-authprovider#manage-your-mfa-provider)
	
   - Review and Identify your organization's identity and security compliance policies as it relates to authentication and MFA.

   - Before choosing a method to implement MFA, review the following to determine your solution requirements:
	 - [What am I trying to Secure?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-whichversion#what-am-i-trying-to-secure)
	 - [Where Are The Users Located?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-whichversion#where-are-the-users-located)
	 - [What Features Do I Need?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-whichversion#what-features-do-i-need)
	
   - Review the following to understand security best practices:
         - [Deploy MFA to the Cloud]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted))
	 - [Best Practices for an On-premises Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/multi-factor-authentication-security-best-practices#best-practices-for-an-on-premises-deployment)
		
   - As a part of the deployment consider the following:
	 - [Configure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings)
	 - [Configure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server for High Availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfaserver-deploy-ha)
